One does not need to live in the southern U.S. to grow the Magnolia. A number of Magnolias grow successfully in southern Minnesota.  
 The ‘Merrill’ cultivar of Magnolia has been reported to be hardy as far north as the University of Minnesota Landscape Arboretum.
 The Magnolia family includes about 200 species of trees and shrubs and, along with Ginkgos, are among the most ancient trees still in existence. Fossilized imprints of Magnolia leaves have been found that date back as far as the Cretaceous period.
 The Merrill Magnolia came about through the work of Max Loebner, a German horticulturalist who worked at the Bonn Botanic garden in the early 1900s. There, he crossed two Japanese Magnolias resulting in a medium-sized tree with beautiful white flowers. From this hybrid, a cultivar was born at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University in 1939 which was named in honor of former Arnold Arboretum Director Elmer Merrill.
 The Merrill Magnolia is a spectacular flowering tree that is a sure sign of spring. Even through it is hardy here, care should be exercised in choosing a planting site. Early spring frosts can damage flowers so a protected location is desirable. After the leaves drop in autumn, attractive silver-gray flower buds offer interest in the winter landscape.
 Other factors to consider when planting a Magnolia would be starting with a container grown plant.  Less root disturbance occurs in this type of planting. The tree grows best in full sun with adequate moisture. There are few insect or disease problems. It may take three to four years for the first blooms to appear.
 The Magnolia flowers begin as large, furry buds that open into broad and showy white flowers that blanket the entire tree. When in full bloom, the Magnolia may resemble a puffy, white cloud.
 WSU’s Merrill Magnolia is nestled in the northwest corner of Somsen Hall. When in bloom, the tree must be enjoyed quickly, since its large, dramatic, white flowers can be lost to strong spring winds and rain.
 WSU also has several Ann Magnolias which produce pink flowers in early spring located along the east side of Pasteur Hall. On the east side of Maxwell Hall, WSU has three young Butterfly Magnolias which produce yellow flowers.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>21</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>21</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/MerrillMagnolia.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> When visualizing Magnolia trees, images of southern cities such as Savannah or Charleston come to mind with fragrant, flowering Magnolia-lined streets.
