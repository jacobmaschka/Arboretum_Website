Leaf prints have been found in fossils throughout North America. The Ginkgo was thought to be extinct only to be discovered by explorers in China in the mid-1700s where trees were preserved around ancient temple gardens.
 The word Ginkgo is derived from the Japanese word “ginkyo” meaning silver apricot, in reference to the trees’ fruit.
 When mature, the Ginkgo is a large, picturesque tree. It begins as an upright columnar growing into an upright oval shape with irregular branching. It usually loses its central leader as several vertical trunks compete for the top position.
 The Ginkgo grows best in full sun and is adaptable to stressful situations. It can grow in poor and compacted soils, and survive heat, drought, various pH levels, and winter salt. In addition, it grows well in urban settings despite air pollution. The Ginkgo has virtually no disease or insect problems. 
 The Ginkgo leaf is unique in many ways. The fan shaped leaf is about three inches long with a petiole of the same size. Usually, the leaf has a vertical slit in the top center, hence the name, biloba, meaning bi-lobed. Leaf veins are somewhat raised giving a ribbed appearance. 
 The fall color can range from chartreuse to golden-yellow. The leaves usually all drop in a day or two following a frost.
 The Ginkgo leaves have been extensively studied for their herbal qualities. The leaves are used in a concentrated form called ginkgo biloba extract that is a best-selling supplement around the world treating a range of medical conditions from memory loss to circulatory problems.
 The Ginkgo has both male and female trees. On female trees, tan-orange fruits are produced in great quantities. These fruits have a rancid odor and create a mushy mess in the fall. For that reason, male trees are the preferred choice for a landscape tree.
 Occasionally, tours of the trees have been offered at WSU. On one such tour several years ago, third graders from Goodview Elementary school were viewing a Ginkgo tree. After learning the importance of planting male trees, one student pointed to fruit on the tree. Up to this point the 40-year-old Ginkgo tree had not produced  fruit and was presumed to be a male tree. Since then, several of WSU’s Ginkgos bear fruit each year.
 Ginkgo trees are scattered across the WSU campus. A number of mature Ginkgo trees can be found along the sidewalk between Pasteur and Phelps Halls.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>15</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>15</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/GinkgoOrMaidenhairTree.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> Dating back more than 150 million years, the Ginkgo is one of the oldest living tree species.
