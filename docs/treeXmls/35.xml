It is one of the tallest trees native to the U.S. with some growing more than 100 feet tall. Records of the tulip tree indicate some trees over 200 feet tall with a diameter of 8-12 feet. Today, a 164-foot tree can be found in Belmont County, Ohio.
 The state tree of Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina is only occasionally found west of the Mississippi.
 The Tulip Tree grows best in deep, rich soil that is well-drained. It has very few disease and insect problems.
  The Tulip Tree has showy, yellow and orange, tulip-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree often does not flower until it reaches 15 years or more in age. Even then, flowering is sparse and occurs more in the lower branches. Heavy flowering throughout the tree occurs only in older, more mature trees. 
 Often, hummingbirds can be found searching for nectar in the flowers. WSU’s Tulip Tree was planted in 2000 as part of a celebration of the completion of the central campus greenspace mall and by 2010 had not yet flowered.
 The leaf of the Tulip Tree is equally fascinating. The large, flat, dark green leaf, like the flower, is somewhat tulip shaped. The tip of the leaf looks as if it has been cut off with a scissors. The fall color provides yellow-golden foliage. In fall 2009, the leaves of WSU’s Tulip Tree hung on the tree unusually long and displayed a stunning bronze color.  
 The Tulip Tree has ancient lineage, dating back more than 50 million years. Though native to North America, fossil leaves of this tree have been found in rocks of Europe and Greenland. More recently in history, the Tulip Tree has been linked to early settlers such as Daniel Boone who is said to have carved canoes from the light buoyant trunks of the tree.
 Some of the largest Tulip Trees in cultivation in the eastern United States owe their origins directly to George Washington, who was described as a landscape architect, or Thomas Jefferson, who had them growing at Monticello.
 Medicinally, the tree had a host of uses. Various teas and ointments were commonly derived from the Tulip Tree.  
 Also called the Tulip Magnolia, Tulip Poplar or Yellow Popular, WSU’s Tulip Tree is actually a member of the Magnolia family. It was made possible through a donation from faculty members and is located in the plaza between Gildemeister and Pasteur Halls.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>35</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>35</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/TulipTree.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> The mighty Tulip Tree is one of the most magnificent trees in North America.
