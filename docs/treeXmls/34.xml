With an upright and delicately rounded crown, this Asian tree has something special to offer. The small yellow-green flowers are arranged in clusters of three as the botanical name, ‘triflorum,’ implies. The leaves are comprised of three deep green leaflets which give way to brilliant orange-red hues in the fall. 
 The exfoliating bark is perhaps the most appealing feature of this tree. The Three-Flower Maple has ash-brown to metallic golden bark that tends to peel away in long thin curls. 
 When planting this tree, care should be taken so the various bark patterns can be viewed optimally. This tree prefers moist, well-drained soil. 
 Since its growth rate is slow, the Three-Flower Maple is well suited for smaller yards or near a deck or patio. Its shape is well-rounded giving the Three-Flower Maple a light and airy appearance. It has no serious disease or insect problems.  
 The Three-Flower Maple is native to the hilly regions of Manchuria, Korea and Northern China. It was first written about in 1901. 
 Ernest Henry Wilson, a pioneer plant material explorer for the Arnold Arboretum located just outside Boston, Massachusetts, brought a specimen back to the United States in 1917. Wilson spent years collecting plant specimens in Asia to bring back for research. The Three-Flower Maple was one of Wilson’s favorites. In 1923, it was first introduced to the public and its availability and popularity grew from the east coast across most of the nation.
 Unfortunately, even today, the Three-Flower Maple is not readily available at nurseries due to propagation difficulties. 
 Two Three-Flower Maples are growing on the Winona State University campus. They are planted close together in the sitting plaza at the west entrance of the WSU Performing Arts Center.  Benches circle each of the Maples allowing visitors to sit and gaze at the nearby water gardens and view the beautiful courtyard.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>34</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>34</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/Three-FlowerMaple.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> This unusual small- to medium-sized maple tree is a true gem in the landscape.
