This native tree can be found from southeast Minnesota to Lake Erie southward to Kentucky. In 1976, it appropriately became the state tree of Kentucky and retained that honor until 1994.
 This pest-free tree is ideal for urban conditions, since it is tolerant of drought and various soil conditions. Moreover, its strong branches can endure winter ice.  
 The Kentucky Coffeetree has a short trunk with bark that is dark with unique, tough, scaly ridges. A cross section of twigs reveals a colorful pinkish to reddish-brown pith. The alternate, bi-compound leaves can reach three feet, making the Kentucky Coffeetree leaves among the largest of any native North American tree.
 The state tree of Kentucky is dioecious, meaning it can be male or female. Despite flowers on both male and female trees, only female trees produce fruit. In late summer, broad, flat pods develop turning dark brown and persist on the tree throughout winter. These hanging seedpods add to the winter interest of the tree.
 The seeds contained within the pod are extremely hard. Some say they are 2,000 times as hard as small jaw-breakers. This thick, hard, seed coat makes germination difficult. Less than 5 percent of seeds germinate on their own. Germination time and success can be aided by soaking seeds in heated water until swollen. Seeds are then scraped to break the seed coating allowing germination to occur.
 In the past, the seeds have had a number of interesting uses. George Washington took seeds from the Coffeetree for planting at Mt. Vernon. Some American Indians roasted the beans (seeds) for food, while early settlers brewed the beans as a substitute for coffee. It should be mentioned that the raw seeds of the Kentucky Coffeetree can be poisonous. 
 The bark of the tree has been used by the Omaha Indians to make an appetizer and a tonic. They mixed the bark of the Kentucky Coffeetree and gayfeather with pulverized parts of buffalo gourd.
 The tree’s scientific name ‘Gymnocladus’ means “naked branch,” since the branches are bare throughout winter.
 WSU’s first Kentucky Coffeetree was planted in the early 1990s and was funded by contributions of university employees to the WSU Foundation. It was one of the first trees planted in WSU’s tree diversification program.
