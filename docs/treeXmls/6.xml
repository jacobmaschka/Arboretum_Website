It is considered an excellent shade tree and can be found from Maine to Missouri and from Southern Ontario to Florida.
 In their native environment, the Black Gum tree prefers the acidic, moist swamplands found in the southeast United States. However, like the Baldcypress, the Black Gum tree can tolerate both dry and wet sites. In addition, the Black Gum has a moderate tolerance to alkaline soils and salt. It is generally free from most insect and disease problems.
 The slow growing, borderline hardy tree, can be difficult to transplant due to its deep taproot. It is a landscape tree used often in parks and large gardens.
 The Black Gum is a medium-sized, picturesque tree known and prized for its brilliant fall color. Black Gums are some of the first trees of autumn to display their colors, which take on a crimson hue that some have said make the branches look like arms of fire.
 The bark is equally intriguing. As the tree matures, the steely-gray bark develops into thick, block like ridges that many have compared to the scales on an alligator.
  Interestingly, the Black Gum or the Sour Gum is named after the extremely sour blue-black berries that wild turkeys and ruffed grouse love to eat. In the spring, the small flowers produce large amounts of nectar which bees use to produce an excellent tasting honey.  
 The strong, difficult-to-split wood of this tree has been used for flooring, pistol grips, and furniture and makes an excellent long-burning firewood.
 The American Indian knew the tree as the Tupelo. As a matter of fact, the Creek Indian word for Tupelo can be translated to “tree of the swamp.” The botanical name for the tree is ‘Nyssa sylvatica.’ In Greek mythology, nyssa refers to a water nymph while sylvatica refers to “of the forest.” 
 When looking toward the creek from the northwest corner of the Tau Center on WSU’s west campus, one can view WSU’s small but stately Black Gum. This specimen was planted in the spring of 2007.
