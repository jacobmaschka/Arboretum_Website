The Autumn Purple variety of White Ash is noted for outstanding maroon to purple fall color. 
 The Autumn Purple Ash is a seedless male tree first found on the grounds of University of Wisconsin campus in Madison. G. William Longenecker, a horticulture professor, and Karl Junginger of McKay Nursery were instrumental in promoting this tree. The first propagated young tree came from the campus tree and was planted at the U.W. Arboretum. Junginger, generally regarded as the discoverer of the Purple Ash, introduced the tree to the public in 1956.
 The Autumn Purple Ash grows to about 50 feet tall. It prefers moist soils and grows fast, sometimes up to two to three feet per year. Purple Ash trees thrive in a sunny location, have good drought resistance and are fairly tolerant of winter street salt. Since these trees are fruitless, there are no seeds and little litter.
 The spectacular fall color is the prominent feature of the Autumn Purple Ash. The deep red and purple leaves stand out in the crisp blue skies of early October. Autumn Purple Ashes can turn various shades of red, purple or maroon depending on temperatures and moisture. After displaying their impressive colors, the leaves drop in a very short time resembling a purple rain. 
 Unfortunately, Autumn Purple Ash trees are threatened by the Emerald Ash Borer, a beetle from Asia that attacks and kills all varieties of ash trees. In the summer of 2002, the beetle was first found in southeast Michigan and has spread to ten nearby states. Tens of millions of ash trees have died since the arrival of this pest that lives outside the tree during summer. EAB larvae feed just below the bark where they are found in tunnels. They disrupt water and nutrient flow; as a result the tree dies.
 By 2009, EAB infestations were found in Minneapolis-St. Paul and south of La Crosse, Wis. Research suggests certain systemic insecticides applied every year or in alternating years may provide protection. 
 As with the American Elm, the Ashes have been over-populated in many cities. Minnesota has a high concentration of Ash trees in the forestland and in urban plantings. Tree diversification has to be a major component of any community’s plan to avoid potential disaster. WSU has led the way in diversifying the tree population on campus since the early 1990s. 
 While many of these trees can be found across campus, perhaps the most impressive Autumn Purple Ash trees at WSU can be found on the south boulevard of Morey-Shephard residence halls on King Street as they form a near canopy over the street.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>4</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>4</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/AutumnPurpleAsh.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> One of Minnesota’s most planted native trees is the White Ash.
