It has a short, straight trunk with a broad, rounded crown. The branches are long and tend to droop at the ends. As an understory tree in the forest, the Ironwood grows in dense shade. When grown in the full sun the tree flourishes and exhibits a desirable rounded shape.
 The most striking features of the Ironwood are its bark and its fruit.
 The gray bark has a finely textured appearance with narrow, shaggy strips on the trunk. The newest shoots are reddish-green with small yet obvious lenticels.  
 The real gem of the Ironwood or Hop Hornbeam is its fruit. The Hop Hornbeam gets its name due to the resemblance of its fruit to true hops. The compound fruit is made up of a cluster of papery or bladder-like sacs each containing a small nutlet. The fruit clusters become noticeable in midsummer as they become light green. In early fall the sacs turn light brown.
 While the Ironwood has a number of qualities as an ornamental tree, its use as a street tree has been limited. One reason is its intolerance to road salt. Another is the tree’s need for adequate rooting space. Boulevards in most cities do not provide for this space unless the tree is planted balled and burlapped. Unfortunately, this is normally cost prohibitive.
 Dr. Harold Pellett from the University of Minnesota has developed a new approach that improves the establishment of roots in trees such as the Ironwood or Hop Hornbeam. This approach, called the “Minnesota system,” involves the use of bottomless containers that sit in water allowing for a denser, fibrous root system.
 The Ironwood is often confused with the Blue Beech or the Hornbeam. The leaves are similar, but the bark of each tree is distinctive. The Ironwood has brownish, grooved and scaly bark, while the Blue Beech has smooth bark.  
 The wood from the Ironwood is very hard and durable. The scientific name, ‘Ostrya,’ comes from the Greek word ostrua meaning bonelike, referring to its hardness. This hardness makes the wood an excellent source in the manufacture of tool handles and fence posts. 
 Native Americans were said to have used parts of the Ironwood to treat various ailments as toothaches and sore muscles.
 Some mushroom hunters claim yellow morels can be found under the Ironwood.
 WSU has Ironwood trees just northwest of the main entrance to the Performing Arts Center including a multi-trunk specimen, and a young Persian Ironwood.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>17</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>1</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>17</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/IronwoodOrAmericanHopHornbeam.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> Ironwood, or American Hop Hornbeam, is a small- to medium-sized ornamental tree native to Minnesota and much of the eastern United States.
