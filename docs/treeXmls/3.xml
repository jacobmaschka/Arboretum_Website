In some parts of the country it has been planted and grown at tree farms and is used as a Christmas tree.  It has adapted to city conditions better than most pines.  When young, the Austrian Pine has a dense, pyramidal shape which develops into a more open, picturesque form with age. The branches of the tree tend to spread wide and hang elegantly. The bark, too, ages gracefully and becomes more striking. Sometimes, the Austrian Pine is confused with the similarly shaped Norway or Red Pine. However, the Norway Pines’ bark is always a much redder-brown color making it easier for tree enthusiasts to discern the difference.  The Austrian Pine is one of the most adaptable of all pine trees to a variety of soil conditions. It will grow in acid and alkaline soils, and it is quite drought tolerant. For more than 200 years, this tree has survived in some of the harshest soil and climate conditions throughout the United States.  Despite its adaptability to most growing situations, the Austrian Pine does have some limitations. One of the limitations is a fungal disease called Diplodia tip blight. This attacks and destroys the stem tips. Another potential problem can be pine nematodes, which can clog the tree’s vascular system.  Bosnia and Serbia have become preferred sources for seed due to the seed’s resistance to another crippling disease of the Austrian Pine, Dothistoma needle blight.  The Austrian Pine is native to Western Europe. Specifically, it is a native to Austria, northern Italy, Bosnia and Serbia. It was introduced to the United States more than 250 years ago. As part of the Great Dust Bowl shelter belt projects in the 1930s, it is estimated than more than 200 million Austrian Pines were planted across the country.  Wildlife of all kind find cover in the branches of the Austrian Pine. Birds and squirrels enjoy the pine seeds. As a young seedling, the Austrian Pine tree can be a popular choice of deer. As a result, if this tree is planted as a landscape tree, it will require protection from wildlife  Two Austrian Pine trees were planted on the Winona State University campus in 2007 and can be found northeast of the solarium on the east side of WSU’s Kryzsko Commons Student Union building.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>3</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>3</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/AustrianPine.png</DefaultImagePath><Description>The Austrian Pine, sometimes called the European Black Pine, has been planted in parks, residential landscapes, and in farm windbreaks across the United States.
