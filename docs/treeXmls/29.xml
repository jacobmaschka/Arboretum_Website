Along with the American Mountain Ash and European Mountain Ash, the Showy Mountain Ash is a member of the Rose family. Interestingly, none of these trees are true members of the Ash genus.
 All three species have bright flowers and colorful fruit making them popular trees for planting in the landscape. Parks, gardens, and wild life areas are known to be excellent planting areas for these trees.
 The Showy Mountain Ash tends to have resistance to disease. However, all three Mountain Ashes are susceptible to fire blight and all tend to be targets for sapsuckers, which attack the trunks of the trees. Of the three, the Showy Mountain Ash’s winter buds are sticker than the others and its leaves are shorter.
 The bright, scarlet berries of the Showy Mountain ash ripen in August and September. The fruit is soft and juicy. They are a favorite food of Cedar Waxwings, Robins, Grackles and Thrushes.
 Despite the leaves being poisonous, the fruit can be eaten and is high in vitamin C and iron. However, eating too many raw berries can cause indigestion. Heat treatment and freezing can neutralize the acids that cause these problems. Collecting berries after the first frost also appears to cut down on the bitter taste. 
 One popular use of Mountain Ash berries is found in the making of jellies and jams.
 According to medicinal folklore, the Showy Mountain Ash inner bark can be used as a wash in the treatment of rheumatism. A concoction of peeled stems is supposedly helpful in the treatment of backaches.
 The Showy Mountain Ash has a rich Christmas background at WSU. Several years ago, on a cold, cloudy day just before the Christmas holiday break, an art student was observed decorating the tree. The student spent hours meticulously winding red ribbon on every branch and twig of the tree, including the trunk. With the red ribbon and the red berries hanging from the branches of the Showy Mountain Ash, WSU had its festive holiday tree for the season. For several weeks students, staff and faculty stopped to gaze at the Showy Mountain Ash.
 WSU’s Showy Mountain Ash can be viewed in the central campus courtyard east of the Kryzsko Commons Solarium, west of the Performing Arts Center main entrance, and just southwest of the End of the Trail Monument.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>29</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>1</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>29</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/ShowyMountainAsh.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> The Showy Mountain Ash is a slow growing, hardy ornamental tree that grows up to 30 feet tall.
