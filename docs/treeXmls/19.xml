 The Littleleaf Linden has smaller leaves, a more pleasing form, and smaller size than the American Linden or Basswood. The Littleleaf Linden, a European introduction, grows rapidly and is extremely winter hardy. In the 17th and early 18th century this tree was planted to form avenues such as the famous “Unterden Linden” in Berlin.
 The Littleleaf Linden is one of the most popular medium-sized shade trees used widely in parks, on boulevards and in residential plantings.  
 It grows well in sun or partial shade, prefers moist, well-drained soils, and tolerates alkaline soil. It transplants easily and can withstand heat and compacted soil better than the American Basswood. The Littleleaf Linden is forgiving of urban pollutants. At the same time, this tree is sensitive to road salt and not very tolerant of drought.
 The Littleleaf Linden is a prolific bloomer with small, fragrant, creamy-yellow flowers that appear in late June and persist for several weeks. The colorful flowers contrast with the dark green leaves. 
 The copious nectar of these flowers attracts bees in such great numbers that a constant humming can be heard in the vicinity of the tree. In addition to bees, the flowers of the Littleleaf Linden are a favorite of hummingbirds.
 Nut-like fruits follow the flowers and ripen in late summer. The unique tan fruit of the Linden resembles a peppercorn and is attached to a leaf-like bract that gently floats to the ground.
 The leaves of the Littleleaf Linden are considerably smaller than those the American Linden or Basswood. Leaves are generally 1¼–2½ inches long and are heart-shaped at the base with a short tapered point. In autumn, the shiny, dark green leaves become a rustic bright yellow.
 Herbal teas made from blossoms of the Littleleaf Linden have been used to treat gastric problems and relieve coughs. The flowers have high concentrations of flavonoids and polyphenols, compounds with antioxidant properties.
 Many cultivars of the Littleleaf Linden can be found. One such cultivar widely planted at WSU, ‘Glenleven,’ is cold hardy and a vigorous growing tree. It tends to have a more open, informal shape.
 At WSU, the Littleleaf Linden can be found lining the boulevards of Mark Street. Other mature Littleleaf Lindens are located north of Somsen-Memorial where they showcase their pleasing pyramidal form.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>19</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>19</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/LittleleafLinden.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> Due to its dense, symmetrical shape, the Littleleaf Linden has become a staple on many boulevards and yards throughout the Upper Midwest.
