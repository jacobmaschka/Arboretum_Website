It is actually a completely distinct species discovered and named after Archibald Menzies, a Scottish naturalist. Menzies first spotted the tree in 1791 on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. David Douglas later identified the tree in 1826, resulting in its common name.
 Much confusion existed in the identification process and that confusion is reflected in the botanical name, ‘Pseudotsuga menziesii.’ Pseudotsuga means false hemlock. The tree was thought to bear a striking resemblance to a Japanese hemlock. Eventually, the botanical name included the resemblance to the Japanese hemlock and gave credit to the discoverer, Archibald Menzies.
 This tree is native to parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. There, it accounts for much of North America’s softwood timber production. In Oregon, the Douglas Fir is planted closely together in thick stands. More than 1.5 billion new seedlings are planted each year to assure timber continually. 
 The Douglas Fir can grow to more than 250 feet in height. The oldest tree, discovered by David Douglas, was found to be about 1,300 years old. The Douglas Firs found in the Rocky Mountains are generally smaller than those found in the Pacific Northwest.
 The Douglas Fir is both drought resistant and fire resistant. Its thick bark protects the tree against fire. One of its major pests is the western spruce budworm, which can defoliate the entire tree. 
 The feature that distinguishes the Douglas Fir from other Firs and Spruces is its unique cone. While the true Fir cone is pointed upward, the Douglas Fir cone hangs downward displaying long, narrow, papery strips. These forked bracts extend from each scale, making identification of the tree easy. 
 A California Native American myth tells the story of how each of the three ended bracts represent a tail and two small legs of a mouse hiding within the Douglas Fir cones, to find protection during a forest fire.
 Besides being an important timber tree, the Douglas Fir is also planted as a Christmas tree and as a landscape tree. As a Christmas tree, the Douglas Fir is especially popular in the Pacific Northwest. As a landscape tree, the Douglas Fir is often planted as a backdrop, since it provides excellent screening.
 This mighty evergreen can be observed in two locations on the WSU campus. One can be seen in the landscape island directly south of Maxwell Hall with two Yellowwoods to its west. The other Douglas Fir can be viewed northwest of Minné Hall.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>13</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>13</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/DouglasFir.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> Even though the Douglas Fir is considered to be a giant of the evergreens, it is not a true Fir, Pine, or even a Spruce tree.
