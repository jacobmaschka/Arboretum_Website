Approximately a thousand varieties can be found throughout the world.
The crabapple can be defined by its size. If the fruit is smaller than two inches in diameter, it is a crabapple. If the fruit is larger, it is usually referred to as an apple.
The visual impact of the crabapple persists throughout all four seasons. In spring, unopened flower buds give a hint of what is to come. Later, buds open to reveal a dazzling display of colors in the flower. Summer’s glossy green foliage is less showy. Autumn showcases the changing colors of the leaves while the fruits are revealed. The brightly colored fruits and the tree’s unusual shape stand out against winter snow.
The crabapple tree is very adaptable: able to survive in compact urban soils, tolerant of drought and poor drainage, and able to moderately tolerate winter salt. The crabapple will grow in both alkaline and acidic conditions.
Disease and insects can be a problem with the crabapple. Insects that may pose problems include aphids, scale, mites, and the eastern tent caterpillar. Apple scab infection and fire blight are two diseases that occasionally trouble crabapples. Planting resistant varieties can help avoid some of these problems.
Crabapple trees set their fruit in late summer. Though some crabapple fruit is eaten raw, it is often very sour. Juice from the crabapple provides an excellent source of pectin that aids in making jellies. Some crabapples are made into tasty ciders.
Records of crabapple trees can be found as early as the ninth century. The pilgrims discovered crabapples in their early days in America, but reportedly did not like the taste of the fruit.
Crabapple trees vary in size and shape. Some are as small as eight feet; others grow as tall as 40 feet. Most mature in the 15-25 foot range. The shape of crabapple trees include weeping, rounded, spreading, upright, vase-shaped, columnar and pyramidal.
WSU is home to an impressive number of varieties of crabapples on the main campus, Lourdes Hall, Tau Center, and East Lake, including: Camelot (fuchsia-pink on white flowers, burgundy fruit), Coral Burst (coral-pink flowers, reddish-orange fruit), Dolgo (white flowers, large red fruit), Donald Wyman (white flowers, glossy red fruit), Golden Raindrops (white flower, golden-yellow fruit), Lancelot (white flower, golden fruit), Prairie Fire (pinkish-red flowers, dark red fruit), Purple Prince (rose-red flower, maroon fruit), Royal Gem (red flower, dark red fruit), Spring Snow (white flowers, no fruit), and Sugar Tyme (white flowers, red fruit).</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>45</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>45</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/SugarTymeCrabapple.png</DefaultImagePath><Description>In southeast Minnesota probably no other ornamental tree can offer as many varieties in flower color, shape, size and fruit as the Flowering Crabapple.
