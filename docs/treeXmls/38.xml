 The species name, ‘alleghaniensis,’ means yellow, alluding to the yellow-bronze bark. 
 The Yellow Birch, a native Minnesota tree, is known to be a long-lived tree averaging 150 years, with some trees surviving up to 300 years. 
 One of the tallest trees in the Birch family, the Yellow Birch prefers well-drained, moist sites. Prolonged periods of drought can severely stress the tree.
 The Yellow Birch can make an attractive addition to the rural and suburban landscape. However, it has been underused by nurseries for many years and can be somewhat difficult to find. 
 The most serious pest to afflict the Yellow Birch is the bronze birch borer. Keeping the tree as healthy as possible will increase the resistance to this problem. Chlorosis, or yellowing of the leaves, occasionally affects the Yellow Birch and may be helped by adding iron to soil.
 The wood from Birch trees has been used for many purposes. Birch has been widely used in the manufacture of furniture, doors, cabinets and veneers for years. It is a hardwood with good bending abilities.
 Native Americans had many uses for the Birch. They used birch bark on their canoe frames and employed the wood for arrows. Some Indian tribes burned birch bark as a repellant for mosquitoes.
 The Yellow Birch has been the popular choice to plant at the White House to honor the mothers of the Presidents of the United States.
 A delightful, wintergreen tasting tea can be made from the twigs. In the spring. wintergreen syrup can be made from the boiled sap of the Yellow Birch. The bark contains oil which has been used in the treatment of both rheumatism and various inflammations.
