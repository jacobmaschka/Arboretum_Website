This fast growing, shade intolerant tree grows straight and tall, reaching up to 80 feet tall. Its name is a reflection of the pleasant, aromatic balsam scent that comes from the buds opening in the spring. This sticky resinous substance that covers the buds protects the buds from insect damage.
 The Balsam Poplar grows best on sandy, moist soils. It is extremely tolerant of very cold conditions, growing as far north as Alaska and northern Canada. The tree has a narrow, open crown and tends to be short lived. It can be distinguished from the closely related Aspen by its longer, narrower leaf, having a whitish underside.
 This Poplar is reported to have certain edible qualities. It is said that in the spring the inner bark can be dried, ground into a powder and used in soups and breads.
 The Balsam Poplar has a long list of medicinal uses. The American Indians used the buds for a variety of purposes. Resin from the buds was used to treat sore throats and to make a cough medicine. It is also reported that in the early spring buds were collected, put in boiling lard, and used as a salve for sprains and swellings. In addition, the American Indians would use the buds as both an insect repellent and a waterproofing agent on the seams of their canoes.
 The bark contains salicin, a glycoside that appears to breakdown into salicylic acid (aspirin). The anti-inflammatory properties of Balsam Poplar bark were especially effective in treating fevers.  
 The Balsam Poplar is also called the Balm of Gilead, a reference to the healing compound that originates from the resin of the tree. The actual name Balm of Gilead has Old Testament origins.  Merchants would travel to the mountainous region of Gilead, situated in present-day Jordan, to buy balm or balsam.
 Today, the Balsam Poplar, along with other Poplars, is being studied as a bio-fuel due to their fast growth.
 WSU’s Balsam Poplar can be found near the west entrance of Kryzsko Commons Student Union building near the loading dock.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>5</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>1</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>5</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/BalsamPoplar.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> Also known as the Balm of Gilead, Hackmatack, Tacamahac and Black Cottonwood, the Balsam Poplar is a tree native to Minnesota and much of Canada.
