# WSU Arboretum Website Redesign
- Deployment can be found at https://jacobmaschka.github.io/HCI-Project
## Overview
- This project was developed in Fall 2023 for CS444 - Human Computer Interaction.
- The purpose was to propose a redesign for the current WSU Arboretum Tree Listing, which can be found [here](https://www2.winona.edu/m/arboretum/directory.asp?t=1) (still current as of May 25, 2024).
- Two team members and I met with members of the arboretum staff to conduct a requirements analysis, create a design proposal, gather feedback, and implement the product.
- Different groups focused on various aspects, such as taking the tour.
## Languages/Technologies
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- XML
- Google Maps API
## Notes for further development
- Some trees are missing images because we were not given all the individual tree XMLs.
- Some of the images we were given were corrupted, causing them to not display properly.
