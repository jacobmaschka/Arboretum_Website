# WSU Arboretum Project
## Overview
- This project was developed in Fall 2023 for CS444 - Human Computer Interaction.
- The purpose was to propose a redesign for the current WSU Arboretum website found [here](https://www2.winona.edu/m/arboretum/) (still current as of May 1, 2024).
- The focus was on the tree listing. Different groups focused on different aspects, such as taking the tour.
## Languages/Technologies
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- XML
## Notes for further development
- Some trees are missing images because were not given all individual tree XMLs.
- Some of the images we were given were corrupted, causing them to not display properly.
