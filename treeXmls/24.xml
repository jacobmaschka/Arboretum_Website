This shallow-rooted native tree is medium-sized and can be grown in a single, upright, oval form or a multi-stemmed specimen.  
 The Paper Birch, the state tree of New Hampshire and affectionately called the “Queen of the Woods,” is a popular landscape tree throughout the Great Lakes region.
 Birches are often referred to as a pioneer tree because they are usually the first tree to re-populate logged or burned areas. In such a location, they may crowd out other species forming a pure stand of white-barked trees.
 The Paper Birch needs full sun and a well-drained soil with cool soil temperatures and adequate moisture. If grown as an ornamental tree, organic mulch is helpful. The Birch has high nutrient needs and requires fertilization to maintain good health.
 The Paper Birch is not able to grow in compact soils, nor does it do well in areas with high pH.  Pollution can be another limiting factor. Furthermore, the bronze birch borer and the birch leafminer can add additional stress on the tree. Newer cultivars have a higher resistance to these insect problems.
 Birch wood has numerous uses. The bark is an excellent fire starter; the wood makes a high yielding fire. It is also used in furniture parts, cabinets and floors.
 American Indians used the outer bark of the Paper Birch or Canoe Birch for the outer layer of their canoes. The waterproofing ability of the Birch bark allowed the making of drinking vessels and buckets. Removal of the thin outer bark does not kill the tree.
 Medicinally, the Birch played a role in American Indian culture. While the Birch is not used in modern herbalism, it was used by Indians to treat skin problems. For example, a poultice of the outer bark was used on burns.
 Sap from the Birch has been used to produce birch syrup. While the sap has lower sugar content than the Sugar Maple, it makes a pleasant drink. The sap can be fermented to make either Birch beer or vinegar.
 The Paper Birch can be found on three sides of WSU’s Performing Arts Center. These birches are now more than 50 years old and give a lasting impression when viewing the building.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>24</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>1</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>24</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/PaperBirch.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> The graceful Paper or White Birch is known for its attractive, white, papery bark.
