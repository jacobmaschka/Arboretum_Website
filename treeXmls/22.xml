 Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, an Italian-American botanist and naturalist, made the first scientific observation of the Catalpa in the 1700s.
 Catalpas like well-drained soils but can adapt to dry or wet areas. The soil pH can range between 5.5 and 7.0. This tree grows best in full sun to partial shade. The Catalpa needs ample space so it can reach a mature height and width without limitations.
 The Catalpa takes seven years before it flowers and 10 years before pods appear on the tree. Catalpa flowers secrete nectar as do the leaves. Nectar glands are found in the base of the petiole or leaf stem.
 The main pest of the Catalpa is the catalpa sphinx caterpillar that devours leaves. Sometimes complete defoliation can occur. While the caterpillar is a nuisance to the tree, fishermen eagerly await the caterpillar’s appearance. Since the 1870s this caterpillar has been regarded as prized bait in the search for trophy catfish.
 The Catalpa tree offers interest in each season of the year. In late June, the tree is decorated with scalloped and ruffled white flowers that cover the entire tree. The flowers appear as though they have been artfully splattered with flecks of purple paint.
 After the flowers fall, about 15-20 percent of the flower areas develop into seedpods. In early summer, the Catalpa’s dark, green heart-shaped leaves are among the largest tree leaves found in Minnesota. Later, long pods form and hang throughout fall and winter.
 The Catalpa is also referred to as the Indian Bean Tree. Early settlers of the Midwest adopted the name Catalpa from the Cherokee Indians that populated the region. 
 In South Carolina, the Catawba Indians smoked the long pods from the tree for medicinal and hallucinogenic reasons. They gave the Catalpa nicknames such as “Indian Cigar Tree,” and “Johnny Smoker.” The leaves of the Catapla are said to relieve pain, especially when applied to cuts and abrasions. Tea made from the bark has been used as both a laxative and a sedative.
 A mature Catalpa can be found just outside the south entrance of WSU’s Watkins Hall. This tree was featured in a center-spread article in the spring 2010 issue of Woodlands &amp; Prairies magazine.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>22</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>22</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/NorthernCatalpa.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> The Northern Catalpa is native to the central Mississippi River Valley but can be found in at least 17 states throughout the U.S. This fast growing, medium to large tree is widely grown as an ornamental tree and can be found in urban areas along streets.
