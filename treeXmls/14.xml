It is native to eastern North America and thrives in the filtered sun of larger trees. It prefers acid soils but is quite adaptable and can grow successfully in alkaline soils. The Fringetree prefers moist, well-drained soils and is quite tolerant of air pollution. No insect or disease problems have been reported with this tree.
 In the woods, the Fringetree can grow to 20-30 feet tall. In landscape plantings, it is more commonly seen at 10-15 feet in height. 
 The bark of the Fringetree is thin and can be easily damaged by mowers or other lawn maintenance machines or pedestrians. 
 When the Fringetree is in full bloom, the sight can be quite spectacular. The airy, 4-6 inch long clusters of fluttering, creamy-white petals hang from the ends of the branches. The blooms appear shortly before leaves are visible in late spring and can persist for about two weeks. 
 The wait for a flowering Fringetree is short. They will bloom after only 5-6 years. In addition, much better blooms occur in the hotter summers.
 The real joy of this tree is discovering its wonderful fragrance. It is a mild but intoxicating scent that immediately attracts one’s attention. The Fringetree’s fragrant flowers are one of the highlights of the spring.
 The Fringetrees’ history goes back to early America, where its medicinal uses were well-documented. American Indians and early colonists used parts of this tree to soothe mouth sores and inflammations of the eye. Today’s holistic approach to medicine considers parts of the Fringetree to be a reliable remedy for problems associated with the liver and gall bladder. The dried root bark has been used for numerous internal disorders. At the same time, the dried, peeled root bark has been employed with a hot compress for infections and wounds.
 The only edible part of the Fringetree is its fruit. Animals of the forest can and do eat the fruit. Some sources report the fruit can be pickled and used as a garnish similar to olives. 
 A small grouping of Fringetrees can be found in two locations on the WSU campus. Two Fringetrees are growing just south of Watkins Hall on each side of the main entrance. Another can be seen east of the main entrance to Stark Hall and the Science Laboratory Center in a planting that surrounds the tall, metal sculpture of migratory birds, called “Flyway.”</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>14</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>14</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/Fringetree.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> The White Fringetree, also known as Old Man’s Beard, is a small-to medium sized-tree.
