It is a colorful alternative to the popular crabapple, since it has similar clusters of white and pink flowers in the spring and persistent orange or red fruit that lasts into winter.
 The fruits are known as “haws” from which the name Hawthorn comes. The Hawthorn is also known for its dense and thorny branches, some of which can be very sharp. Its botanical name, ‘Crataegus,’ reflects its character in its meaning, “flowering thorn.” The term crusgalli refers to the similarity of the long spines to the spurs of a rooster.
 Depending on taxonomic interpretation, the actual number of Hawthorn varieties ranges from 200 to 1,000. 
 Hawthorns are tolerant of most soils. They do well in most urban situations. Because the Hawthorn is a member of the Rose family, it is susceptible to many of the insects and diseases of Roses.
 Many cultures have found intriguing uses for Hawthorn fruit. Jams, jellies, juices and alcoholic beverages are made from the tart, bright red fruit of the Chinese Hawthorn. In Mexico the fruit of the Mexican Hawthorn are eaten raw, cooked or put into jams. They are also stuffed into piñatas in pre-Christmas parties.  In the southwest United States, fruit from three varieties of Hawthorn are made into a delicacy resembling a jelly. Not only are the fruits edible, but the leaves, if picked early in the season, are tender and tasty in salads.
 The medicinal properties of the Hawthorn have been known for some time. Parts of the tree were hung over doorways in the Middle Ages to ward off evil. By the 1800s, the flowers and berries were used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments of the heart. Recent studies have shown Hawthorns contain antioxidant properties that may stop damage from free radicals. Hawthorns contain flavonoids and Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins (OPCs), which are likely to benefit the heart.
 The Cockspur Hawthorn has white flowers which appear to explode throughout the tree in late spring. WSU has three thornless Cockspur Hawthorns, which can be found in the courtyard east of the Kryzsko Solarium in an arch around a sitting bench donated by WSU faculty members Vivian Fusillo and George Bolon. 
 Two other Hawthorn varieties growing at WSU, the Washington and Winterking Hawthorn, can be viewed just south of Maxwell Hall.
