 The Bur Oak tree is known for its massive size. These large trees do best when they have ample room for growth. For example, the national champion Bur Oak is located in Kentucky and measures 96 feet tall and 103 feet in width. 
 Growing native throughout the upper Midwest including in Minnesota, the Bur Oak is the official state tree of Iowa.
 The Bur Oak has the ability to grow in many different sites. While the Pin Oak shows chlorosis when grown in neutral or alkaline soils, the Bur Oak is very tolerant of alkaline soils. The Bur Oak’s extensive root system allows the tree to survive even when challenged with severe drought conditions. The Bur Oak is generally considered to be slow-growing and difficult to transplant due to its deep taproot. The taproot can grow up to four feet in the first year.
 Due to its deeply furrowed bark, the Bur Oak is so fire resistant that many giant specimens have survived over time. It has competed successfully with many prairie fires during dry conditions. 
 The fringed acorns of the Bur Oak are the largest of all native oak acorns. They are a popular source of food for wildlife. Mature acorns are sweet and edible, but often infested by Nut Weevil larvae. 
 During winter months, the silhouette of the Bur Oak tree displays its twisted and contorted branches, leaving a haunting image, reminiscent of a scene from an Edgar Allan Poe novel. 
 Early pioneers often encountered breakdowns of their covered wagons on the journey west. Since the Bur Oak was found across the prairie, its wood was used to repair wagon tongues, spokes and wheel hubs. Legend states that Lewis and Clark met with Native Americans under the Council Oak in what is now Sioux City, Iowa. At that time the tree was 150 years old. It survived until the 1970s.
 The WSU campus is home to several Bur Oaks. One, which was planted in the mid 1990s, can be found southeast of McCown Gymnasium of Memorial Hall, while two other Bur Oaks are located on Main Street just south of the intersection with Howard Street. Three younger Bur Oaks are growing on the south side of WSU’s East Lake apartments.
