The tiny leaves emerge in the spring with a purple/pink tint. The leaves become bluish-green in the summer, and finally turn an apricot-orange in the fall.  
 The scent produced by the fallen leaves has been compared to burned brown sugar, bonfire toffee, cotton candy floss, or even cinnamon. The leaves of the Katsura resemble those of the Redbud.  However, Redbud leaves are alternately positioned on the branch, not opposite as are Katsura leaves.
 Water is especially important during the establishment period of the Weeping Katsura and during dry periods. This tree also tends to be difficult to transplant.
 The Japanese name for the tree is Katsura. It can be found in the low mountains of both Japan and China. Some trees in this region have been found to reach 130 feet high and incredibly the same in width.
 Legend has it that the common name Katsura alludes to the tale of a Chinese monk who discovered the secret of eternal life. Not content with this he went on to commit a hideous crime, for which he was sentenced to go to the moon to cut down a 5,000 foot tall tree. The image of the man in the moon is supposedly the condemned man trying to accomplish this monumental task. This gives rise to the idea of a Katsura as an unachievable dream or impossible goal.
 The Weeping Katsura tree is a perfect centerpiece in a Japanese garden. It acts as an anchor with various Japanese plant materials. The tree also acts as a very stately specimen for any park or golf course. 
 Two types of Weeping Katsura tree exist. One type has many trunks with no central leader. The type WSU has growing on campus is one possessing a strong central leader originating from one clone in Marioka, Japan. This Weeping Katsura is grafted at about five feet off the ground to produce the pendulous effect of a cascading waterfall.  
 Fittingly, in its location just southwest of the main entrance of WSU’s Performing Arts Center with its tiered water gardens, the Weeping Katsura tree has found a suitable home on campus.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>36</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>36</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/WeepingKatsuraTree.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> The Weeping Katsura Tree is an eye-catching, colorful, medium-sized tree that is recognized by its smaller heart-shaped leaves.
