Although the two trees have similarities, the Butternut has elongated nuts, hairy stems, flattened ridges on the bark and a beige-pink wood.   
 The Butternut is native to much of the Midwest and Northeast United States, including Minnesota.
 The Butternut tree prefers deep, rich, well-drained soil and does not transplant well. The tree has a slow growth rate: about one foot per year under optimal conditions. The Butternut demands full sun and is shade intolerant. It is also very susceptible to fire damage. Like its cousin the Black Walnut, the Butternut produces a chemical known as juglone in its roots that is toxic to many nearby plants.  
 Unfortunately, Butternut trees are dying of a fungal disease called Butternut canker. The first documented case of Butternut canker was found in Wisconsin in 1967. Infected areas or cankers can be found on large branches or on the trunk and are usually fatal to the tree. It has killed up to 80 percent of Butternuts in some states. There currently is no cure for the disease.
 Native Americans found various ways to use the Butternut. They boiled the kernel within the nut to extract the sweet oil which was used as butter. Early settlers to America would pickle Butternut kernels in vinegar.
 The Eastern Band Cherokees saw how Butternut trees and River Cane could grow near each other despite the toxic root chemical. The Cherokee used parts of the Butternut tree as natural medicines and foods. Traditionally, they used the juglone in the tree roots to numb tooth pain, to rid the body of tapeworms, and as an antibiotic tea. 
 The Butternut fruit or nut was a favorite food for its high protein, and vitamins, and as an essential fat source. In addition, the nut husks and tree bark were used to make a dye for river cane baskets.
 Today, the Butternut is still used in many ways. The nuts are popular in eating and baking. In New England maple-butternut candy is a regional delight. The lightweight wood is a favorite of carvers.
 At WSU, a young Butternut can be found on the main campus just west of Kryzsko Commons. Another is located about 50 yards northwest of Tau Center on WSU’s west campus, near the fire pit.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>9</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>1</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>9</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/Butternut.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> Butternut, also called White Walnut, Demon Walnut and Oilnut, is a close relative of the Black Walnut.
