 The Shagbark Hickory, the most common of all hickories, has a distinctive shaggy bark which is found only in mature trees. Its common name comes from the ashy, gray mature bark that separates from the trunk in long shaggy strips. 
 This full, straight tree can reach heights of 100 feet or more and can live up to 200 years. Lower branches of a mature Shagbark Hickory tend to droop while upper branches are more horizontal. A large yard is required if the Shagbark Hickory is planted as a landscape choice. 
 The tree is valued for its tasty nuts, but also for the golden-yellow color of its fall foliage.
 The slow-growing Shagbark Hickory can often be found among oak trees. The Shagbark Hickory grows best in well-drained soils. A long, deep taproot supplies water to the tree in times of drought but also makes it a difficult tree to transplant. 
 The fruit of the Shagbark Hickory is an edible nut with excellent flavor. Squirrels and other wildlife compete with people for these desirable nuts that were a favorite of the American Indian and early colonists of the United States. American Indians gathered and cured the nuts. Then, a nutmeal was extracted from the shell. The word hickory is derived from the word, pawcohiccora, an Algonquin word that roughly translates to “a ground meal from the nuts.” 
 Other uses of the Shagbark Hickory include the use of the bark extract to make smoky, nutty, sweet syrup. This hickory syrup goes back to a centuries-old recipe that is still being used by a couple in Indiana who produce the unique syrup that is in high demand from gourmet chefs, backyard cooks and even the weekend beer maker. 
 Shagbark Hickory wood is strong and tough. It is used for tool handles and athletic equipment such as skis. Shagbark Hickory is highly valued as firewood because of its high heating value and smoky flavor.  It is the preferred wood for smoke-curing meats such as bacon and ham.
 To observe WSU’s Shagbark Hickory, look between Kryzsko Common’s Baldwin Lounge on the east side and Minné Hall’s west side entrance. </AttributeValue><EntitiyId>27</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>1</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>27</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/ShagbarkHickory.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> The Shagbark Hickory is native to southeast Minnesota and its native range stretches all the way to the Great Lakes, southern New England and southeast Canada.
