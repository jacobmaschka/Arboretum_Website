The Thornless Honeylocust is more desirable since few thorns are found on the new cultivar.  
 This tree has a high tolerance to salt and pollution and became a popular choice in extreme urban settings such as parking lots and boulevards. Its only limitation is a minor canker and insect problem.
 With the destruction of the elm tree by Dutch elm disease, many cultivars of the Thornless Honeylocust have been planted in cities throughout the Midwest. Unfortunately, the Thornless Honeylocust has been over-planted in many Midwest urban areas.  The current recommendation is that “its use be discouraged until adequate biodiversity is restored.” 
 A pleasing feature of the Honeylocust is its small leaflets that allow light shade to permeate to the ground. This allows turf to grow underneath the tree as well as partial-shade perennials.
 The trunk and lower branches of the common Honeylocust are covered with prickly thorns. Since thorns are a nuisance, the Thornless variety was developed. However, the source of the Thornless Honeylocust is not a separate plant. Growers take cuttings from the upper branches of the common Honeylocust where there are no thorns and propogate the Thornless Honeylocust varieties.
 The botanical name for the Thornless Honeylocust is ‘Gleditsia tricanthos var. inermis.’  The word inermis signifies being unarmed.
 The pods of the common Honeylocust have had a number of uses. American Indians ground dried pulp from the pod and made a sweetener. The fermented pulp was made into a drinkable beer. It is reported that pulp of the Asian Honeylocust was used as an alternative for soap. Indians roasted seeds and used ground, roasted seeds for a coffee substitute.
 WSU has a number of Thornless Honeylocusts. The two most common cultivars on campus grounds are ‘Skyline’ and ‘Sunburst.’ 
 A number of Skyline Honeylocusts are on Huff Street near  King Street. Four Sunburst Honeylocusts grow on the south side of Phelps Hall. New foliage on these trees begins as a bright gold which eventually turns green. The Honeylocust in the main photo can be spotted at Tau Center.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>33</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>33</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/ThornlessHoneylocust.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> The fast-growing Thornless Honeylocust is a variety of the common, native Honeylocust tree.
