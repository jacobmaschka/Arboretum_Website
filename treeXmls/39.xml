This member of the pea family can be found in its native range of North Carolina to Kentucky and sometimes as far west as Illinois.
 The Yellowwood can grow to 40-50 feet tall with a trunk diameter sometimes two feet thick. It often has multiple trunks and has attractive smooth, gray bark.  
 The Yellowwood thrives in a wide variety of soils and tolerates both acidic and high pH sites. It also has virtually no insect or disease challenges and has a life span averaging 50-75 years. In addition, the tree has a nice yellow fall color. The Yellowwood has somewhat fragile wood that is prone to storm damage.
 The Yellowwood is prized for its showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in large, pendulous clusters that can reach one foot in length. The tree won’t necessarily bloom every year, nor does the whole tree bloom. 
 Yellowwood trees produce a small, flattened, brown seedpod that is about three inches long. The pods develop in late August and ripen in October.
 The Yellowwood was discovered by French botanist, Andre Micheaux, exploring in eastern Tennessee in 1796. Near Fort Blanc along the Cumberland River, Micheaux spotted something new and different. Even though in a winter blizzard, he saw the smooth gray bark standing out in the snow and realized the short multi-branched tree was unique. Soon, he saw the heartwood was yellow and could be used as a dye. During the 19th  century, dye makers used yellow wood chips from this tree to make the dye.
 Micheaux’s son, Francois, gave the Yellowwood one of its several scientific names, ‘Virgilia lutea,’ meaning “pleasant to remember.”
 The Yellowwood is an ideal accent tree that adds diversity to any landscape. Pruning in mid-summer is recommended since winter pruning can cause cracking, and spring pruning can lead to excessive sap loss. Nurseries grow this tree from seed, making it slow to mature.
 One of WSU’s Yellowwood trees thrives in the sunshine near Lauren’s Pond north of the Performing Arts Center. Two other Yellowwoods grow just south of Maxwell Hall.</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>39</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData><AttributeValuesData><AttributeName>Minnesota Native</AttributeName><AttributeType>Boolean</AttributeType><AttributeValue>0</AttributeValue><EntitiyId>39</EntitiyId></AttributeValuesData></AttributeValues><DefaultImagePath>https://w3.winona.edu/Locations/Resources/Yellowwood.png</DefaultImagePath><Description> The Yellowwood or American Yellowwood gets its name from its heartwood which is a deep yellow color.
