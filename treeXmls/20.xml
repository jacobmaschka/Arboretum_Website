The hybrid, which is a cross between the Oriental Plane and the American Plane (Sycamore), first appeared in London in 1645 and has survived England’s air pollution for several hundred years. 
 The tree has a curious method for coping with air pollution. The bark of the tree is continuously peeling– or exfoliating– revealing a lighter colored bark underneath. This process allows air particulates to shed themselves, and at the same time, prevents those same harmful pollutants from entering and clogging up air pores in the bark.
 In addition to withstanding air pollution, the London Planetree can survive drought and compacted soils. It thrives in full sun, but cannot tolerate too much shade. Even fairly large trees can be transplanted easily. It has strong limbs able to withstand severe storms. Due to its potentially large size, the tree requires ample space.
 The London Planetree does better than the American Planetree or the Sycamore due to its resistance to a fungal disease called anthracnose. In fact, WSU’s cultivar of the London Planetree, ‘Bloodgood,’ possesses the highest resistance to anthracnose.
 The leaves of the London Planetree have been compared to the maple leaf, but they are larger, up to 6-7 inches long and sometimes 10 inches wide. The Planetree leaf is positioned alternately on the stem, while maple leaves are opposite each other on the stem. This information can be helpful in identification.
 The botanical or scientific name, ‘Plantanus,’ is derived from the Greek word platys which means broad or wide; ‘Acerifolia’ refers to the maple likeness of the leaves.
 One of the largest trees in Europe is a Planetree that can be found on the Greek island of Kos. People living on the island claim the huge tree was planted by the great physician, Hippocrates, about 400 B.C. According to legend, he taught his medical students underneath the tree.
 The London Planetree has a number of interesting medicinal properties. Various uses of the leaves supposedly treat conjunctivitis, diarrhea and wounds. Its bark has been boiled in vinegar to treat both hernias and toothaches.
 WSU’s London Planetree is located just northwest of the Tau Center on the west campus.
